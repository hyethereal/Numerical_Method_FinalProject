# Numerical_Method_FinalProject
Hi, I'm Ian Huang, and this is my final project for Numerical Methods. I chose to simulate pollutant diffusion, using finite difference methods for the numerical approach. This involves solving the diffusion equation through discretization in both space and time. For further instructions, please refer to the following tutorial video.
